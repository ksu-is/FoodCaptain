It is hard enough to decide where to eat on your own, but it can be all the more difficult to consider everyone’s preferences in a group. To help simplify this, this program will get user input for location, cuisine, and budget. It will then scrape Yelp and consider the user’s requirements as well as the rating of the restaurant. Once the program has gathered the list of restaurants that meet the user’s requirements, it will select one of them at random and display it to the user.
It will also handle common issues when making this decision in a group. For example, if the group is split 50/50 between two different cuisines, the program will pick one for them. If someone can’t decide what to eat at the restaurant or is feeling particularly adventurous, it will also have the option to help with which item specifically to order on the menu. To start, this will be simplified into a random choice from the number of menu items. I would like to make it more complex to consider modifying menu items or adding dessert as well.
