1. [x] Create README
2. [x] Install Yelp Data Scraper
    I'm struggling with how to properly clone the parts that I need from the original Yelp Scraper.
    Tried dragging files from yelpscraper repository. It doesn't seem like it worked.
    Tried following the installation instructions from the original repository. Is the code too dated?
3. [x] Look into Scrapy
4. [x] Identify problems with Yelp Data Scraper
5. [] Work each problem
6. [] Document attempts to solve issue whether successful or not
7. [x] Check Yelp Scraper in Inedible
8. [x] Identify issues with this scraper
    This scraper is heavily intertwined with Excel. Could still be useful but not intial plan
    Removed this scraper although I may add it back if I can't get the other one to work
9. [x] Work each issue and document attempts to solve whether successful or not
10. [x] Decide which version works best
    I think RavenHustler's version is better but maybe a bit complex for what I'm trying to do. Looking for another option.
11. [x] Write the section that will gather user input and display the selected restaurant back to them.
