1. [x] Create README
2. [x] Install Yelp Data Scraper
    I'm struggling with how to properly clone the parts that I need from the original Yelp Scraper.
    Tried dragging files from yelpscraper repository. It doesn't seem like it worked.
    Tried following the installation instructions from the original repository. Is the code too dated?
